# Sprite Animation Clip Previewer
A Unity window editor tool for previewing sprite animation clips without the need for a GameObject with an Animator and Animator Controller.  
This tool is a part of my [SpookyCore](https://github.com/daothienphu/SpookyCore) foundation framework.

# How to use
Open the window at `Tools/Sprite Animation Clip Previewer`.  
Drag an animation clip into the Animation Clip field to preview.

# Settings
- Made from spritesheet: Clips made from a spritesheet are a bit different from clips made from independent sprites. Make sure to check this box appropriately to get the correct sprite preview.
- Show Frame Info: Show the frame index and the frame name for each frame in the clip.
- Frame per second settings: Drag the slider or input the fps in the field to set the fps of the clip.
- Time seek settings: Drag the slider to seek the corresponding frame. You can also select the previous or next frame, or play and pause the animation.
